| Build    | Could you clone from Git and build using the README file? | was able to build using the Readme file. Readme file was easy to follow and had step by step instructions. | We took measures to ensure the README file remains as clear and as easy-to-follow as possible moving forward. |
| Legibility | Was the flow sane and were variable names and methods easy to follow? Does the code adhere to general guidelines and code style? | The code adhered to general guidelines of code style and variable names were easy to follow. All the functions in JavaScript files had sane variable names which were easy to follow. | We took steps to make sure the code stays at this quality or better. |
| Implementation | Is it shorter/easier/faster/cleaner/safer to write functionally equivalent code? Do you see useful abstractions? | The implementation was clean and safe, and it will be easy to write a functionally equivalent code. | We continued to work on consolidating the code so that it is even more efficient than from during the code review. |
| Maintainability | Are there unit tests? Should there be? Are the tests covering interesting cases? Are they readable? | There were no unit tests done. | We ultimately decided that unit tests were not necessary in this UI-oriented project and that consistent functional testing was a better use of our time and energy for this project. |
| Requirements | Does the code fulfill the requirements? | The code almost fulfills the requirements. It only lacks the database to actually work with the real inventory. | We completed the database implementation and fully integrated it into the project. |
| Other | Are there other things that stand out that can be improved? | Other things that can be improved is the user interface of the app. | We have accepted all recommended changes with open ears and have attempted to incorporate what we feasibly could within the remaining time we had. |

| Build    | Could you clone from Git and build using the README file? | I was able to clone the project using the README file easily. The instructions were clear and straight to the point. The document has spacing to, so it made it easier to go step by step. The instruction where introduce in only three section which made it so easy to know what to do. Of course, if the user doesn't have a good understanding of computer science will not be able to compile it. As a computer science student, I found it clean how to compile it and run it. | We took measures to ensure the README file remains as clear and as easy-to-follow as possible moving forward. |
| Legibility | Was the flow sane and were variable names and methods easy to follow? Does the code adhere to general guidelines and code style? | The way the code implemented is clear. Looking to the variable names, I was able to understand how each element constructed. Each function had a clear heading and represented its task and how it contributes to the code. There is minor function that I had to read the function before and the one after to be able to understand the structure of the code. | We took steps to make sure the code stays at this quality or better. |
| Implementation | Is it shorter/easier/faster/cleaner/safer to write functionally equivalent code? Do you see useful abstractions? | The way the code is written is written well in most of the time. Checking the written file as manifest.json, index.html, ...etc. I could understand how the code works. It was easy since the majority of the code was in line and indented where it supposed to be indented. Plus, there was almost no running the code for long lines, so I didn't have to put the screen in full screen mode or scroll to read all the code. | We continued to work on consolidating the code so that it is even more efficient than from during the code review. |
| Maintainability | Are there unit tests? Should there be? Are the tests covering interesting cases? Are they readable? | The maintainability of the code is there. The code could be change easily since there are many files and each one has a specific task. Even throughout the testing everything was able to connect with the other file without any issue. Each file had their own correct directory too. It is easy to go through the code and files without any difficulty. | We continued to keep our code base organized and easy to navigate.  |
| Requirements | Does the code fulfill the requirements? | (No critique was provided.) | We believe that we have fulfilled all of the requirements in our project and are continuing testing to ensure that we have done so. |
| Other | Are there other things that stand out that can be improved? | The design could be improved. It looks good, but as a person who does art, I wish if they had a person where their task to only focus on the colors of the design and some of the shapes proportions. Great job overall! | We agree that having a professional designer for this project would have been lovely so that we could have a UI specialist/team make the most state-of-the-art design choices, but we are working to make our website as aesthetically pleasing as possible while also still being practical, functional, and up to the client’s satisfaction. |

| Build    | Could you clone from Git and build using the README file? | Yes, it seems other members were able to just follow along and get the website running. The README provides a straightforward approach detailing very specific instructions. I was not able to compile their code, but that seems to be due to an npm issue on my side. Otherwise, going through the review the team has satisfied their client requirements. | We took measures to ensure the README file remains as clear and as easy-to-follow as possible moving forward. When issues arise with compilation, we work to fix them as quickly as possible. |
| Legibility | Was the flow sane and were variable names and methods easy to follow? Does the code adhere to general guidelines and code style? | Yes, the code is simple to understand and follows conventions for web design. They have also provided comments to the code and have named their files appropriately. Looking through their code files as well, variables follow naming conventions and are consistent. | We took steps to make sure the code stays at this quality or better. |
| Implementation | Is it shorter/easier/faster/cleaner/safer to write functionally equivalent code? Do you see useful abstractions? | The code makes use of React libraries and creates abstraction when needed to help reduce the backend clutter. | We continued to work on consolidating the code so that it is even more efficient than from during the code review. |
| Maintainability | Are there unit tests? Should there be? Are the tests covering interesting cases? Are they readable? | The team also mentioned that during testing they simply do some visual testing and checking the backend database. The team also mentioned that they do manual testing to make sure that all the prices add up and that users can go through the motions of ordering a pizza. | We ultimately decided that unit tests were not necessary in this UI-oriented project and that consistent functional testing was a better use of our time and energy for this project. |
| Requirements | Does the code fulfill the requirements? | The team’s code satisfies all the requirements. | We have fulfilled all of the requirements in our project and are continuing testing to ensure that we have done so. |
| Other | Are there other things that stand out that can be improved? | (No commentary was provided.) | We have accepted all recommended changes with open ears and have attempted to incorporate what we feasibly could within the remaining time we had. |

| Build    | Could you clone from Git and build using the README file? | The README file had clear instructions on what needs to be installed and how to set up all the required packages in order to run the project. I cloned the project into my local machine using the instructions available. | We took measures to ensure the README file remains as clear and as easy-to-follow as possible moving forward. When issues arise with compilation, we work to fix them as quickly as possible. |
| Legibility | Was the flow sane and were variable names and methods easy to follow? Does the code adhere to general guidelines and code style? | Reading through the code implementation I found it easy to understand because of the way it was written and the majority of the comments on the code made sense. | We took steps to make sure the code stays at this quality or better. |

| Other | Are there other things that stand out that can be improved? | I believe the overall visualization of the website still needs some improvements. From what I understand that their main task is to upgrade this pizza website application into a more modern, easy to navigate web page. Therefore, making further changes to some of graphic designs and interfaces would improve the web page. I think focusing on the structure first is the way to go here considering how the original pizza wb page was very basic but hard to navigate. Overall great job and I like what you guys accomplished with this. | We have accepted all recommended changes with open ears and have attempted to incorporate what we feasibly could within the remaining time we had. |

| Build    | Could you clone from Git and build using the README file? | Yes, the repository was easily runnable. | We took measures to ensure the README file remains as clear and as easy-to-follow as possible moving forward. When issues arise with compilation, we work to fix them as quickly as possible. |
| Legibility | Was the flow sane and were variable names and methods easy to follow? Does the code adhere to general guidelines and code style? | The coding convention seems consistent. Nothing seems outlandish beyond what I believe are typoes. | We took steps to make sure the code stays at this quality or better. |
| Implementation | Is it shorter/easier/faster/cleaner/safer to write functionally equivalent code? Do you see useful abstractions? | It looks like they follow the standard MVC architecture for modern websites. There are strange bits where the same styling is inlined multiple times, but that’s easily refactorable. | We continued to work on consolidating the code so that it is even more efficient than from during the code review. |
| Maintainability | Are there unit tests? Should there be? Are the tests covering interesting cases? Are they readable? | No unit tests, however it is difficult to test UI. | We ultimately decided that unit tests were not necessary in this UI-oriented project and that consistent functional testing was a better use of our time and energy for this project. |
| Requirements | Does the code fulfill the requirements? | Seems to meet most of the requirements (at least for front end). Code seems good. | We have fulfilled all of the requirements in our project and are continuing testing to ensure that we have done so. |
| Other | Are there other things that stand out that can be improved? | Since the backend isn’t hooked up yet, I don’t know how it will be implemented. However, I would highly recommend being careful with how remote site administration is set up. This is definitely one part that cannot be implemented incorrectly. | We are taking as many modern security precautions as we can to ensure our content management system is secure and only accessible by authorized entities. |

| Build    | Could you clone from Git and build using the README file? | Yes. Very clear and straightforward. It was easy to follow through to access the dev site. | We took measures to ensure the README file remains as clear and as easy-to-follow as possible moving forward. When issues arise with compilation, we work to fix them as quickly as possible. |
| Legibility | Was the flow sane and were variable names and methods easy to follow? Does the code adhere to general guidelines and code style? | Well organized in folders. Really easy to navigate in a text editor. Code is readable, usable. Able to run dev, unable to run build, start. | We took steps to make sure the code stays at this quality or better. |
| Implementation | Is it shorter/easier/faster/cleaner/safer to write functionally equivalent code? Do you see useful abstractions? | I think their code is really clean, as an React
application. | We continued to work on consolidating the code so that it is even more efficient than from during the code review. |
| Maintainability | Are there unit tests? Should there be? Are the tests covering interesting cases? Are they readable? | I don't think unit tests are needed here. Console log output is good enough. | We ultimately decided that unit tests were not necessary in this UI-oriented project and that consistent functional testing was a better use of our time and energy for this project. |
| Requirements | Does the code fulfill the requirements? | Yes, very clear and followed great coding style. Well organized. | We have fulfilled all of the requirements in our project and are continuing testing to ensure that we have done so. |
| Other | Are there other things that stand out that can be improved? | Beverages menu: Unnecessary scrolling. Could minimize the time that the user needs to scroll down to view the rest of Beer, wine list and so on. Description/Price box under menu: The box follows while using scroll. That's fine. When I tried to see other pizza’s details, instead of refreshing the box and showing the newer msg, it showed 2 boxes and one on top of the other. (Pepperoni description -> Garlic Des -> Garlic Price) | We have accepted all recommended changes with open ears and have attempted to incorporate what we feasibly could within the remaining time we had. |
